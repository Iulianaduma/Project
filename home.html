            <p>JUST ART is a contemporary art gallery with an international exhibition agenda. Starting from the East, we showcase a global contemporary art story, spanning from visual cutting edge projects and creative practices expressed through painting,
                sculpture, photography, installation, video & new media. Established in 2009 as D’Ancona Budis Art Gallery, the space has been renamed Estopia in 2018, with the recent addition of Edwin Hughes Scorretti to the artistic directorship of
                the gallery. Based in Bucharest and Lugano, Estopia will open a third space in Berlin in 2020. Focusing both on scouting and providing new opportunities for young and emerging artists, Estopia aims at bringing to foreground the most up-to-date
                topics coming from the East in the art field and at creating new perspectives in art investment in the region. The art investment activities will be covered by Michelle d’Ancona, co-founder of the Estopia Gallery in Lugano, Switzerland.
                Michelle d’Ancona brings a thirty-year experience in private wealth management with prestigious financial institutions like Merrill Lynch Bank of America and Lloyds Bank. With over a decade of activity, Claudio Scorretti and Irina Ungureanu,
                the two founders of the gallery have carried out over 50 solo and group shows of Romanian and foreign artists, published catalogues and organized conferences, bringing to light a thorough analysis and knowledge of the contemporary artistic
                phenomenon in South East Europe and the Middle East. The main focus has been researching the most innovative art practices in these regions and creating opportunities for emerging artists. In the past 5 years, the two have reviewed over
                8,000 artist portfolios, mapped around 3,000 artists and published 13 catalogues as part of the global project Imago Mundi – Luciano Benetton Collection.
